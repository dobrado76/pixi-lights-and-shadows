You are absolutely right. My previous suggestion for the "Inverted Render" trick was flawed. You have correctly identified its critical performance problem: rendering a flipped world per reflective sprite is not efficient and does not scale.
More importantly, you have described a completely different—and far more advanced—graphical feature. What you are asking for now is not simple planar reflection. You are describing local, inter-surface color bleeding.
This is an advanced global illumination (GI) technique. It's the effect that makes a red carpet cast a subtle red glow onto a nearby white wall.
The good news is that there is a well-known, high-performance technique to achieve exactly this, and it is a much better fit for your forward-thinking engine than the simple planar reflection trick.
The Correct Technique: Light Propagation Volumes (LPV) in 2D
The feature you want is a form of real-time Global Illumination. The most common and performant way to achieve this for dynamic scenes is with Light Propagation Volumes (LPV). While typically a 3D technique, it can be brilliantly adapted to a 2.5D context using 2D textures (a "2D Voxel Grid").
The Concept: "Bleeding Light Through a Grid"
Imagine you lay a low-resolution grid over your entire game world.
Inject Light: In a first pass, you identify all the surfaces in your scene that are emitting light. This isn't just your light sources; it's also any bright, colored surface. You render these "Virtual Point Lights" (VPLs) into your 2D grid texture. For example, the bright green gem would inject green light into the grid cells it occupies.
Propagate Light: This is the magic step. You run a multi-pass shader that "blurs" or "bleeds" the light from each grid cell into its neighbors, over and over. This simulates light bouncing around the scene. The green light from the gem's cell will bleed into the adjacent cells, then those cells will bleed it further, and so on. This propagation happens very quickly on the GPU.
Apply the Illumination: In your final composite shader, for every pixel of every object, you do a simple lookup into the final, fully-propagated light grid texture. This gives you the color of the bounced, indirect light at that position in the world. You then add this color to your final image.
The result: The purple shape, being next to the green gem, will be in grid cells that have received "bled" green light. When it samples the LPV grid, it will pick up this green illumination and add it to its own color, creating the exact effect you described.
Why LPV is the Perfect Solution for You
It Solves Your Exact Problem: LPV is specifically designed to simulate real-time, multi-bounce color bleeding between dynamic objects.
Highly Performant: The core of LPV runs on very small grid textures (e.g., 64x64 or 32x32), making the propagation step incredibly fast. The final lookup is just a single texture sample per pixel. It is vastly more efficient than screen-space techniques for this effect.
Scales to a Full GI System: This is not just a one-off trick. It's a foundational Global Illumination system. It will handle color bleeding, but it can also be used to create soft ambient light from large emissive surfaces and other complex lighting phenomena.
Fits Your Architecture: It is yet another independent, additive post-processing pass. It will not break your existing lighting or shadow code. You will create the LPV texture in a separate pass and then add its contribution at the very end of your main shader.
A Safe and Practical Implementation Plan
This is an advanced feature, but it is a standard and well-documented one.
Create the LPV Grid Textures: In your PixiDemo.tsx, you will create a few low-resolution PIXI.RenderTexture objects that will serve as your 2D voxel grid.
Write the "Light Injection" Shader: This is a new, simple shader. For each object, it will check its color and brightness. If it's a bright object, it will render it as a colored spot into the LPV grid texture.
Write the "Propagation" Shader: This is the core of LPV. It's a shader that reads from the LPV grid, samples the colors of its four neighbors (up, down, left, right), averages them, and writes the result back out. You run this shader several times to simulate the light "bleeding" across the grid.
Final Shader Integration: You will add one new uniform to your main fragment.glsl:
code
Glsl
uniform sampler2D uLightPropagationVolume; // The final LPV grid texture
Then, at the very end of your shader, you add the final contribution:
code
Glsl
// ... after all your direct lighting, IBL, shadows, and AO ...

// Sample the indirect bounced light from the LPV
vec3 indirectBouncedLight = texture2D(uLightPropagationVolume, worldPos / uCanvasSize).rgb;

// Add it to the final color
finalColor += indirectBouncedLight;

gl_FragColor = vec4(finalColor, diffuseColor.a);
Add UI Controls: Expose controls for "GI Bounces" (how many times you run the propagation shader) and "GI Intensity" to give yourself artistic control over the effect.
This approach is the correct, modern, and performant solution to the specific visual goal you have described. It will give you the beautiful, subtle color bleeding that makes a scene feel cohesive and realistic, and it will do so without breaking any of the fantastic work you have already completed.
